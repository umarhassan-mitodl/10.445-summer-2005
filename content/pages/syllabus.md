Course Description
------------------

The goal of this course is to provide an insightful overview of the fundamentals of downstream processing for biochemical product recovery. Through reading assignments and homework sets, emphasis is given to fundamental modes of recovery and purification that the scientist and engineer are most likely to encounter in the laboratory and in industrial settings. However, guest lectures by distinguished researchers from both academia and industry in the field of biochemical engineering are also used to demonstrate new concepts and emerging technologies that are likely to benefit biochemical product recovery in the future.

Prerequisites
-------------

Familiarity with some of the general aspects of process control and development, as well as general knowledge of chemical engineering principles including thermodynamics, chemical kinetics and transport processes, will be necessary for success in this course. Knowledge of mathematics, especially differential equations and basic statistics (i.e. the normal probability distribution) is necessary for dealing with the engineering aspects of the course. It is expected that students will be proficient in the use of MicrosoftÂ® Excel for spreadsheet calculations that are necessary for the completion of many homework assignments.

Grading
-------

Grading will be based on five homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
